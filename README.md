## Data Sources
1. Global case data from [JHU CSSE data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
    - The data source is updated 3 times a day to catch up with any updates during the day.
2. US State & county level data from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
    - The data source is updated 3 times a day to catch up with any updates during the day.

## Data Quality Observations
1. Global data and US state & county data is refreshed at different times and different sources. Therefore, there is always a discrepancy in data for US in Global and US specific dashboard.
2. For below countries, the **_recovery data is not provided for each region_**. Subsequently the derived data like mortality and survival rates are also inaccurate for these countries.
    - **Countries:** _United Kingdom, Netherlands, France, Tajikistan_
